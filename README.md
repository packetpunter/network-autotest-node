## Note: This code currently doesn't [Work on Windows](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2084)
## Usage
### Preamble
One must have vagrant and virtualbox installed for this to work.

[Vagrant Download](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)

[VirtualBox Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

### Actual Usage
```git clone https://github.com/packetpunter/network-autotest-node```

```cd network-autotest-node```

```vagrant up```

```vagrant ssh``` to connect to the Vagrantbox.

Inside the Vagrantbox:

There will be two files generated by this: one is a autonetscript- file that has the speedtest results, and
the other file is an .svg file representing the traceroutes. Until git push from this program is enabled, you'll
have to browse to the ```network-autotest-node/sync``` folder to view the logfile and svg file.
