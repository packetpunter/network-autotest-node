# network-autotest-node
## Note: This code currently doesn't [Work on Windows](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/2084)
## Usage
### Preamble
One must have vagrant and virtualbox installed for this to work.
[Vagrant Download](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)

[VirtualBox Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

### Actual Usage
```git clone https://github.com/packetpunter/network-autotest-node```

```cd network-autotest-node```

```vagrant up```

Inside the Vagrantbox:
```sudo python3 /app/basicTest.py```

```cd ~```

There will be two files generated by this: one is a speedtestAuto- file that has the speedtest results, and
the other file is a .svg file representing the traceroutes. Until git push from this program is enabled, you'll
have to copy these from /home/vagrant out to your machine to open in a web browser.
